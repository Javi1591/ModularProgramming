# Java Assignments 5 & 6 – Methods, Loops, and Modular Programming

Two Java console applications demonstrating the use of **methods**, **loops**, and **structured modular design**.  
These assignments reinforce reusability, parameter passing, and iterative control structures to handle user-driven processes.

## Assignment 5 – Methods and Parameter Passing

### Description
A Java program that introduces user-defined methods to perform calculations or formatted operations.  
It demonstrates the use of **value-returning methods**, **void methods**, and **parameter passing** to modularize functionality.

### Features
- Defines multiple reusable methods for computation or output formatting.  
- Demonstrates both **value-returning** and **void** method types.  
- Accepts and passes parameters to methods for flexible data handling.  
- Organizes logic for readability and maintainability.  
- May include mathematical, string, or menu-based operations.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define and call custom methods in Java.  
- Practice scope and lifetime of local variables.  
- Differentiate between returning and non-returning methods.  
- Reinforce the concept of modular programming.

### Files
- `Nazario_Assignment5.java` (example filename) – complete source file implementing Assignment 5.

## Assignment 6 – Loops and Repetition Structures

### Description
A Java console application that performs repetitive operations using **for**, **while**, and/or **do-while** loops.  
The program may involve accumulating totals, generating tables, or performing repetitive calculations until a user chooses to stop.

### Features
- Demonstrates use of:
  - `for` loops for counted iteration.  
  - `while` or `do-while` loops for conditional repetition.  
- Integrates input validation within loops.  
- Optionally uses **nested loops** for tabular output.  
- Displays results with structured formatting and summaries.

### Learning Objectives
- Apply looping constructs to perform repetitive tasks.  
- Integrate control flow and condition-based repetition.  
- Practice incremental calculations and iterative problem solving.

### Files
- `Nazario_Assignment6.java` (example filename) – complete implementation for Assignment 6.

## Program Structure
Each Java file includes:
- Header comment (author, date, description).  
- Organized indentation and descriptive variable names.  
- A single `main()` method that coordinates calls to additional helper methods.  
- Clear separation of logic, input, processing, and output.
